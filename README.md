ðŸš€ Excited to share my first AWS ETL end-to-end project using AWS Glue! ðŸ“¦ðŸ”—

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
AWS Glue to build my first ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. This project allowed me to explore various AWS services like S3, IAM, and AWS Glue. It was an amazing experience.

ðŸ”¹ AWS S3:
AWS S3 served as the storage platform for my data. I leveraged its scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness to store the raw and transformed data throughout the ETL process.

ðŸ”¹ IAM:
To ensure secure access and permissions management, I utilized AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management). IAM allowed me to define granular access policies, granting appropriate permissions to AWS Glue for data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.

ðŸ”¹ AWS Glue:
AWS Glue,played a pivotal role in my ETL pipeline. It provided an easy and efficient way to extract data from various sources, perform transformations using built-in or custom scripts, and seamlessly load the transformed data into the target destination.
